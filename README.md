# Introduction

## Description

Improve your life with Adrestia. We want to introduce to you Adrestia.  
Adrestia provides you with an Ansible script that automatically sets up  
your own cloud on your own server. If you've never heard of Ansible or  
what a server is, don't worry. We will explain it to you later on.

First of all imagine you have a server somewhere. In simple terms,  
a place where you can store your data. And on this server  
you want to store maybe your photos, your movies, your financial data,  
your music and so on. But you dont know how to set this all up.  
That's where Adrestia comes in. Adrestia does that all for you automatically.  
So you only need to run the Ansible script provided by Adrestia and there you go.  
Many different applications are available to you afterwards. These are stored  
on your server and only accessible through you over a VPN. No access by third parties.  
Only through you and the people you want to give access to.

## Persona

Which person is Adrestia made for? Let us look at an example.  
Julia is a 27 year old women, who works in management at a medium  
sized company. She is digitally native \(e.g. can handle a computer\),  
but has no direct experience with programming or for example setting up a server.

![This is Julia :\)](.gitbook/assets/julia%20%281%29.jpg)

On a normal working day Julia wakes up at 6 am. She has breakfast and then reads  
the news online. Afterwards Julia goes to work at 7 am, which ends at 4 pm.  
After work Julia goes shopping. She checks her current budget in advance  
with a finance app to estimate how much she will buy. Then Julia goes home  
and has dinner at 5:15 pm. During dinner Julia looks at her last made photos  
about food on her mobile phone. At 6:15 she rides out on her own horse and  
tracks where she rides. Before going to bed, she watches a movie on Netflix  
at 8am and does yoga with music at 10am.

What can we learn from this example? Julia uses various services from  
different providers throughout her everyday life. She thus passes on her  
data to strangers. That is exactly what Julia wants to change with Adrestia   
now and maybe you too.
