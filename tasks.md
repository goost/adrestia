# Tasks

- [ ] Repo:
    - [ ] Set-up automatic semantic versioning
    - [ ] Set-up automatic release creation
        - What does a release entail?
- [ ] Bootstrap
    - [ ] O: AnsiblePlay: Encrypt System (?)
        - Non-trivial + Complicates startup (encryption needed via dropbear + ssh + passfifo key)
        - Does it always so? Maybe less secure but easier way exists?
    - [ ] AnsiblePlay: SetUp Python
    - [ ] AnsiblePlay: Install docker + compose
    - [ ] AnsiblePlay: SetUp VPN Connection
        - [ ] Setup docker bridge network for services
        - [ ] Use docker openVPN image for key creation
        - [ ] Leave keys at server or backup locally?
            - At server: easier, less secure, no backup -> server crash, all puff
            - Local: harder to maintain(need to scp every time?), backup in user's hands, more secure? less secure?
            - -> encrypted backup local + leave at server?
        - [ ] Create Client Config
            - With Extra route + DNS push 
        - [ ] SCP client config to local
        - [ ] Create OpenVPN image with enabled DNS port-forwarding
            - Jeez, how the heck did we do that? What was the name of the program? XD
        - [ ] Create Autostart for openvpn container
            - Systemd service vs. docker restart always
    - [ ] Install OpenVPN on local (?)
        - Or must client to on your own?
        - Or write complete program which uses OpenVPN lib for connection?
            - Way to overkill for now :D
    - [ ] O: Reconnect via OpenVPN (?)
    - [ ] AnsiblePlay: Harden System
        - [ ] Change SSH Port
        - [ ] Create new Keys (? -> Preexisting are bad because? User used PW login!)
        - [ ] Set Up Firewall (or setup Hoster-Firewall?)
        - [ ] SetUp unattended updates
            - Auto-restart vs. no auto-restart
                - Bad on encrypted system, easy on non
        - [ ] O: Sophisticated auto-update for docker-images
            - Cron Job?
            - Docker Watchtower?
            - Or Each Service-Play sets up own update routine?

    - [ ] Persona Creation
        - [ ] Julia, 27
            - photo
            - Timetable (workday + free day)
            - personality
            - day-to-day life
            - why does she need + would use the software?

            - [ ] poster/one a3 page description
    - [ ] _EXTREMELY GOOD_ documentation/installation guide
        - DAU user must be able to follow
        - must explain external steps (e.g. renting server) too
        - must have an FAQ for all steps
        - must have pictures
        - should use GitBook (or the new hot shit equivalent which I forgot the name of...something made in Rust?)
        - must guide through installation routine, even though installation program should be self-guided
    - [ ] O: Mechanism for backing up volumes with data
        - [ ] ... Well, how indeed?
        - Maybe an extra image which tar.gzs. all volumes with special name?
        - Or is there an image for that already, for backing up docker data-volumes?
        - Either way, this is __NOT__ minimal :D
    - [ ] Do we need Traefic or Caddy for proxing?
- [ ] O: Optional
