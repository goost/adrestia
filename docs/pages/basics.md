# Basics

## What is a server and how can it be rented?

A server is a computer or program that provides resources or services to other computers, such as your own over a network. To rent such a server there are different providers on the Internet.

## What is a Virtual Private Network \(VPN\)? And what is OpenVPN? 

In a VPN, two parties are involved. A VPN client e.g. a software on your computer and a VPN server e.g. a software on your server. Between these two parties an encrypted connection is established through a VPN, with which you can access your server in a protected way.

## What is Ansible?

In simple words Ansible is a tool with which, for example, a server can be remotely configured automatically. This means that you can use Ansible to describe how a system, e.g. a server, should be configured using a so-called playbook on your own computer. Ansible then configures the system automatically from your computer via a connection to the system using your description, more precisely your playbook. A Playbook can be seen as a kind of text file in which you write various commands that Ansible understands and can later execute for you. 

## What is Docker?

Docker is a tool with which applications can be run using so-called containers. A container is a small encapsulated area. In this area, for example, an application can be created and run. The individual containers can be addressed and connected by a network. This network is called a docker network.

## What is Docker Compose?

Docker Compose is a tool that allows applications to run in multiple containers. For this purpose, a so-called Docker Compose file can be created with Docker Compose. In this file, the individual applications that are to be started in containers can be described and their configuration adapted. The Docker Compose file can then be executed by Docker Compose and Docker Compose will automatically create all containers defined in the file.
